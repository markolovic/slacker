Slacker is an application that tracks your scores and grades for all of your classes. It also calculates "weight" of each individual assessment so that you can compare the "cost" of slacking on each of them. What's more valuable? Attending the in-class quiz, doing the weekly homework, or scoring 10% higher on the exam?
